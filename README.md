# Time Tracker

Windows desktop application for employee time keeping. 

Formerly employees had to track their time in separate applications, SAP for financials, and PlanPort for resource management. Now the application consolidates time entry into a singular application while authenticating and applying proper business rules so that employees can do all of their time keeping in one simple to use application.
